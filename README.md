# Oasis-infobyte-task2
📌 Project Overview

This project was completed as Task 2 of my Data Analytics Internship at OASIS.
The objective of this task is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices based on various property-related features using Linear Regression.

🎯 Objective

To understand the relationship between house features and prices

To preprocess and prepare data for modeling

To implement a linear regression model

To evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

To visualize and interpret prediction results

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information related to housing properties, including both numerical and categorical features such as:

Area

Number of bedrooms and bathrooms

Parking availability

Main road access

Furnishing status

Air conditioning

Preferred area

Price (target variable)

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

🔍 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration

Loaded the housing dataset using Pandas

Examined data structure, summary statistics, and data types

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Checked for missing values

Encoded categorical variables using label encoding and one-hot encoding

Selected relevant features for modeling

3️⃣ Model Development

Split data into training and testing sets

Built a Linear Regression model

Trained the model on training data

4️⃣ Model Evaluation

Evaluated performance using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared (R²) score

Analyzed residuals to assess model accuracy

5️⃣ Data Visualization

Actual vs Predicted price scatter plot

Residual plot

Correlation heatmap

📈 Results & Insights

The model demonstrated a reasonable fit for predicting house prices

Certain features such as area and furnishing status showed strong influence on price

Visualization helped in understanding prediction accuracy and errors

📚 Learning Outcomes

Hands-on experience with regression modeling

Improved understanding of feature engineering

Practical exposure to model evaluation techniques

Strengthened data visualization skills

🚀 Conclusion

This task provided valuable experience in building and evaluating a predictive model using real-world data.
It enhanced my understanding of regression analysis and its application in data analytics.
